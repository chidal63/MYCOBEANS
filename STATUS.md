# MYCOBEANS website — STATUS FREEZE

Last update: 2025-12-25

## Scope and purpose
Public website for the MYCOBEANS project (MSCA Staff Exchange).
The site is a **project showcase and transparency tool**, not a stakeholder engagement platform.
No marketing funnel, no newsletter, no user profiling.

Primary functions:
- public visibility of the project
- clarity of objectives and consortium structure
- audit- and review-proof dissemination

---

## Technical stack
- GitHub Pages
- Jekyll (Minimal Mistakes theme)
- Static site (no backend)
- Baseurl correctly handled (`/MYCOBEANS`)

Analytics:
- GoatCounter (privacy-friendly, cookieless)
- No Google Analytics
- No cookies set by the website

---

## Pages — COMPLETED
- Home
- The Project  
  → concise, mobility-centred narrative aligned with MSCA Staff Exchange
- Objectives  
  → objectives framed as functions of staff mobility, not RIA-style deliverables
- Consortium  
  → cards with logos, short descriptions and PI / Industry contact  
  → differentiated grids (EU/UK vs Thailand)  
  → UNIPR and NSTDA-BIOTEC displayed as full-width single cards  
  → PI information visually subordinate to institutions
- Events  
  → working listing page  
  → standardised post template  
- Resources  
  → minimal placeholder for publications, presentations, repositories, protocols
- Contact  
  → standalone page, no forms, no personal emails exposed
- Privacy & Imprint  
  → minimal, GDPR-safe, updated for GoatCounter

---

## Editorial and design principles
- Short, dense texts (no proposal-style verbosity)
- No exaggerated claims or promises
- Clear distinction between:
  - academic partners
  - non-academic public research
  - industrial partners
- Intersectoral dimension described as practice, not slogan
- Logos visually standardised via layout, not file editing
- Industry uses “Industry contact”, not PI

---

## Explicit decisions (do not revisit unless necessary)
- No newsletter
- No stakeholder engagement mechanisms
- No Google Analytics
- No detailed open science claims until content exists
- No over-polishing at the expense of clarity

---

## Deferred / future work
- Visual polish (typography, spacing, fine alignment)
- Accessibility fine-tuning
- Population of Open Repositories
- One-page PDF summary of the project
- Optional enhancement of Events (secondment/workshop templates)

---

## Current status
Website is **release-ready** and coherent with MSCA Staff Exchange expectations.
All core content and compliance elements are in place.

Next work to resume from this freeze point.
