# MYCOBEANS website — STATUS FREEZE

Last update: 2026-01-26

## Scope and purpose
Public website for the MYCOBEANS project (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Staff Exchange).

The site is a **project showcase and transparency tool**, not a stakeholder engagement or communication platform.
No marketing funnel, no newsletter, no user profiling.

Primary functions:
- public visibility of the project
- clarity of objectives, structure and consortium roles
- audit- and review-proof dissemination

---

## Technical stack
- GitHub Pages
- Jekyll (Minimal Mistakes theme)
- Static site (no backend)

Domain & deployment:
- Custom domain: **www.mycobeans.eu**
- HTTPS enabled
- Site served from root domain (no subdirectory)

Analytics:
- GoatCounter (privacy-friendly, cookieless)
- No Google Analytics
- No tracking cookies set by the website

## Pages — COMPLETED
- Home  
  → institutional landing page with clear MSCA Staff Exchange framing
- The Project  
  → concise, mobility-centred narrative aligned with Staff Exchange objectives
- Objectives  
  → objectives framed as functions of staff mobility, not RIA-style deliverables
- Consortium  
  → cards with logos, short descriptions and PI / Industry contact  
  → differentiated grids (EU/UK vs Thailand)  
  → UNIPR and NSTDA-BIOTEC displayed as full-width single cards  
  → coordinating institution visually emphasised  
  → PI/contact information visually subordinate to institutions
- Events  
  → working listing page  
  → standardised post template for meetings, workshops and project activities
- Resources  
  → structured page for public outputs  
  → publications listed  
  → oral communications at international conferences listed  
  → governance note defining inclusion criteria  
  → placeholders for repositories, protocols and supporting material
- Contact  
  → standalone page, no forms, no personal emails exposed
- Privacy & Imprint  
  → minimal, GDPR-safe, updated for GoatCounter

## Editorial and design principles
- Short, dense texts (no proposal-style verbosity)
- No exaggerated claims or promised impacts
- Clear separation between:
  - academic partners
  - non-academic public research organisations
  - industrial partners
- Intersectoral dimension described as practice, not slogan
- Outputs framed as *relevant to the scientific scope* rather than claimed as direct project deliverables
- Logos visually standardised via layout and controlled scaling, not file manipulation
- Industry uses “Industry contact”, not PI

---

## Explicit decisions (do not revisit unless necessary)
- No newsletter
- No stakeholder engagement mechanisms
- No Google Analytics or equivalent profiling tools
- No premature open science claims
- No individual-level storytelling on the website
- No over-polishing at the expense of clarity and robustness

---

## Deferred / future work
- **Secondments page**  
  → not yet implemented  
  → to be designed as a structured overview of mobility activities (intersectoral and interdisciplinary), not as personal narratives
- Visual polish (fine typography and spacing)
- Accessibility fine-tuning
- Population of Open Repositories (when mature and public)
- One-page PDF summary of the project
- Optional refinement of Events templates (secondment- and workshop-specific)

---

## Current status
Website is **live, stable and release-ready** on the custom domain.
All core content, governance and compliance elements are in place.

The next development phase will start from the design and implementation of the **Secondments** section.
