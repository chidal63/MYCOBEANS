**MYCOBEANS** is an MSCA-funded research project addressing emerging mycotoxin risks in beans and legumes used as alternative plant protein sources, with the aim of strengthening food safety and supply chain resilience under climate change.

## Why MYCOBEANS?
Climate change and changing agricultural practices are reshaping the risk profile of food contaminants. In this context, mycotoxins in legumes represent an emerging and still underexplored challenge for food safety and sustainable plant-based protein systems.

## What the project does
- investigates the occurrence of emerging mycotoxins in beans and legumes;
- advances analytical and diagnostic tools for mycotoxin detection;
- evaluates toxicological risks associated with emerging contaminants;
- develops biotechnological mitigation strategies across the plant protein supply chain.

## A global research alliance
Coordinated by the University of Parma (Italy), MYCOBEANS brings together academic and non-academic partners from the EU, the UK and ASEAN countries to promote knowledge exchange, capacity building and long-term research collaboration.
