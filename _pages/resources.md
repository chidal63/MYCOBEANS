<h3>About this page</h3>

This page provides a curated overview of public outputs relevant to the scientific scope of MYCOBEANS.  
Listed items include peer-reviewed publications, conference contributions and selected supporting materials that are publicly accessible and considered mature for dissemination.

Conference presentations and publications are included when they are thematically aligned with the project objectives and involve members of the consortium, regardless of whether they originate directly from secondment activities.

Materials under development, preliminary results and non-public documents are intentionally excluded.  
This approach ensures clarity, consistency and transparency throughout the duration of the project.
