## Aim

MYCOBEANS brings together academic and non-academic partners to address the emerging risk of mycotoxins in beans and legumes, a food category increasingly used as a source of alternative plant proteins. The project aims to support **food safety and supply-chain resilience** in the context of climate change by **combining scientific expertise with applied, real-world perspectives**.

## Research Objective

MYCOBEANS pursues this aim through three closely connected research objectives, designed to generate robust knowledge, enable practical action and build long-term capacity.

**Objective 1 – Strengthen detection and monitoring of mycotoxins**
The project aims to improve the identification and monitoring of mycotoxins in beans and legumes by aligning analytical approaches across laboratories and sectors. This objective supports the generation of high-quality, comparable data reflecting real contamination scenarios and enabling reliable crop monitoring.

⸻

**Objective 2 – Develop effective and sustainable mitigation strategies**
MYCOBEANS seeks to translate data into actionable solutions by integrating computational tools, biotechnology and toxicological expertise. The focus is on exploring bio-based mitigation strategies that are scientifically sound, feasible in practice and compatible with modern food and feed systems.

⸻

**Objective 3 – Build skills and connections across sectors**
The project supports intersectoral training for early- and middle-career scientists, enabling them to work across disciplines and between academia and industry. Through mobility and shared expertise, MYCOBEANS contributes to the development of professionals equipped to address complex food safety challenges.
