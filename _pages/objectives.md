## Aim

MYCOBEANS brings together academic and non-academic partners to tackle the **emerging risk of mycotoxins in beans and legumes**, which are increasingly used as alternative plant protein sources.
The project aims to support food safety and strengthen supply-chain resilience in the face of climate change, by combining **scientific excellence with real-world relevance**.

## Research Objective

MYCOBEANS pursues its mission through three closely connected research objectives, designed to generate knowledge, enable action, and build lasting capacity:

**Objective 1 – Improving how we detect and monitor mycotoxins**
The first objective focuses on strengthening how mycotoxins are identified and monitored in beans and legumes. By aligning analytical approaches across laboratories and sectors, MYCOBEANS aims to generate robust, high-quality data that reflect real contamination scenarios and support reliable crop monitoring.

⸻

**Objective 2 – Designing effective and sustainable mitigation strategies**
RO2 aims to turn data into solutions. By bringing together computational tools, biotechnology, and toxicological insight, the project explores innovative, bio-based strategies to reduce mycotoxin risk in food and feed. The focus is on approaches that are scientifically sound, realistic, and compatible with modern food systems.

⸻

**Objective 3 – Building skills and connections across sectors**
The third objective is dedicated to people. MYCOBEANS provides intersectoral training opportunities for early- and middle-career scientists, enabling them to work across disciplines and between academia and industry. By fostering mobility and shared expertise, the project helps build a new generation of researchers equipped to address complex food safety challenges.
