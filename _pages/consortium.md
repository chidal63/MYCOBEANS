## Consortium overview

MYCOBEANS is implemented by a multidisciplinary and intersectoral consortium composed of academic and non-academic organisations from Europe, the United Kingdom and ASEAN countries. The consortium brings together complementary expertise in analytical chemistry, toxicology, biotechnology, bioinformatics, molecular biology, food chemistry, food processing and regulatory science, ensuring full coverage of the project objectives and a strong integration between research and application.

## Coordinating institution

**University of Parma (UNIPR)** — *Italy*  
UNIPR coordinates the project and ensures scientific coherence, governance and dissemination activities. The institution contributes expertise in food safety, mycotoxin analysis and risk assessment, providing a central reference point for interdisciplinary integration across the consortium.

## Academic partners

Thammasat University (TU) — Thailand
TU contributes expertise in analytical chemistry and interlaboratory method development, supporting the detection and monitoring of mycotoxins in beans and legumes.

University of Vienna (UNIVIE) — Austria
UNIVIE provides expertise in toxicology and exposure assessment, contributing to the evaluation of health risks associated with mycotoxin occurrence.

Queen’s University Belfast (QUB) — United Kingdom
QUB supports knowledge transfer and training activities, with experience in interdisciplinary education, dissemination and public engagement.

## Non-academic partners

National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) — Thailand
NSTDA contributes expertise in biotechnology and fermentation processes, supporting the development of bio-based strategies for mycotoxin risk mitigation.

## International and Intersectoral Framework

The consortium builds on the existing network of the International Joint Research Center on Food Security (Thailand), providing a platform for long-term collaboration, staff mobility and capacity building across regions.
Intersectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration is embedded through staff exchanges, expert visits and joint activities involving early-career and senior researchers, ensuring effective knowledge transfer and skills development within a highly multidisciplinary environment.
