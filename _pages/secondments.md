## Mobility patterns

### A1. Interdisciplinary mobility (core activity)

Interdisciplinary mobility is the core secondment activity in MYCOBEANS.  
The project implements short-term exchanges connecting complementary scientific domains involved in mycotoxin risk assessment in legumes.

Mobility activities primarily involve **early-career researchers** moving between academic institutions in Europe, the United Kingdom and ASEAN countries, enabling hands-on cross-disciplinary learning. **Senior researchers** are involved selectively when advanced methodological alignment or strategic integration across disciplines is required.

Interdisciplinary mobility is organised around recurrent exchange patterns, supporting cumulative capacity building and a shared methodological language across the consortium.

---

### A2. Intersectoral mobility (technology transfer–oriented)

Intersectoral mobility supports **targeted transfer of technology and applied know-how** between academia and non-academic partners.

These secondments are **short and tightly scoped**, focusing on method implementation, workflow adaptation and feasibility assessment under real-world constraints. Intersectoral mobility complements interdisciplinary exchanges by anchoring scientific developments to applied and industrial contexts.

---

### A3. Applied research organisations

MYCOBEANS includes mobility involving **applied research and technology transfer organisations** operating at the interface between academic research and industrial application.

These organisations act as **bidirectional hubs**, hosting early-career researchers for applied training and supporting senior-level exchanges focused on validation, optimisation and technology adaptation.
