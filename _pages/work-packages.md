MYCOBEANS is structured into five inter-related Work Packages (WPs), designed to support the research objectives and provide clear deliverables and milestones across the project.  [oai_citation:9‡SEP-210927078-MYCOBEANS-Part B1.docx](sediment://file_00000000cd3871fca8b9ff355964ac77)

## WP1 — Advanced diagnostics for mycotoxin detection
**Type:** Research  
**Lead:** TU  
**Timing:** Month 1–42  

Focus: develop and validate advanced and rapid diagnostic tools for regulated and emerging mycotoxins in beans/legume-derived ingredients, including transferability across labs and testing under industrial scenarios.

## WP2 — Integrated platform for combined toxicity and safety assessment
**Type:** Research  
**Lead:** UNIVIE  
**Timing:** Month 6–42 

Focus: integrate occurrence data with toxicological and exposure assessment approaches, including the investigation of combined effects with naturally occurring phytochemicals to inform risk(-benefit) evaluation.

## WP3 — Biotechnological mitigation
**Type:** Research  
**Lead:** NSTDA  
**Timing:** Month 6–48  

Focus: develop bio-based mitigation strategies (e.g., tailored enzymes/fermentation) under a “safe-by-design” approach and assess feasibility along the ingredient and processing chain.  [oai_citation:16‡SEP-210927078-MYCOBEANS-Part B1.docx](sediment://file_00000000cd3871fca8b9ff355964ac77)

## WP4 — Knowledge transfer and public engagement
**Type:** Training, Communication, Dissemination  
**Lead:** QUB  
**Timing:** Month 1–48  

Focus: structured training and knowledge transfer across partners, plus outreach and public engagement activities supporting dissemination and capacity building.  [oai_citation:18‡SEP-210927078-MYCOBEANS-Part B1.docx](sediment://file_00000000cd3871fca8b9ff355964ac77)

## WP5 — Project management, dissemination and exploitation
**Type:** Management  
**Lead:** UNIPR  
**Timing:** Month 1–48  

Focus: coordination, monitoring and governance, plus dissemination/exploitation planning and long-term sustainability beyond the project duration.  [oai_citation:20‡SEP-210927078-MYCOBEANS-Part B1.docx](sediment://file_00000000cd3871fca8b9ff355964ac77)
