MYCOBEANS adopts the principles of **open science** as promoted by the European Commission and aligns its data management practices with the **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).  
In this context, MYCOBEANS aims to make data generated and/or used within the project as FAIR as possible, while ensuring compliance with ethical, legal, and intellectual property requirements.

## MYCOBEANS GitHub
To provide a central place for storing and managing resources produced or used within MYCOBEANS, we use **GitHub**, an online platform that enables transparent version control, collaborative work, and public access to selected outputs.
