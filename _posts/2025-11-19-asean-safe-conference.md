Partners of the MYCOBEANS project took part in the international conference ASEANSafe2025 – Safer Food in a Climate Challenging Era, held in Bangkok and focused on emerging food safety challenges under climate change.

At the conference, MYCOBEANS highlighted a critical but often overlooked issue: mycotoxin risks in pulses, a key protein source for sustainable food systems. The project develops innovative tools for monitoring, diagnosis, and mitigation of these contaminants, combining advanced research, a One Health perspective, and international collaboration.

Participation in ASEANSafe2025 strengthened dialogue between research, industry, and policymakers, reinforcing cooperation between Europe and ASEAN and supporting the translation of science into practical solutions for safer, more resilient food chains.

👉 Food safety is not just a technical issue — it is a global challenge that demands collaboration, solid data, and long-term vision.
