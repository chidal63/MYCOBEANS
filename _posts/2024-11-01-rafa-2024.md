We’re proud that representatives from the MYCOBEANS project contributed to the “Food integrity from an EU–Asia perspective” session at RAFA 2024, the 11th Recent Advances in Food Analysis symposium in Prague. This session brought together EU and Asian research efforts tackling growing challenges in food safety and authenticity—core elements of food integrity research.  ￼

RAFA 2024 is a leading forum on cutting-edge analytical and bioanalytical strategies for food quality and safety. It covers a broad range of emerging issues—from contaminant detection to authenticity and regulatory science—with a particular focus on cross-regional collaboration.  ￼

By participating in this EU–Asia food integrity dialogue, MYCOBEANS underscored how shared scientific frameworks, harmonized approaches, and international partnerships are essential to advance food integrity across jurisdictions and supply systems. The session was a strategic opportunity to exchange insights, align analytical standards, and strengthen cooperation between European and Asian researchers working at the frontier of food safety and authenticity.  ￼

Food integrity isn’t just about data—it’s about building a global, interoperable understanding of risks and solutions that protect consumers and value chains across continents.
