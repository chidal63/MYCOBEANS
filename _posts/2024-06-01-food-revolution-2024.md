Prof. Chiara Dall’Asta, Coordinator of MYCOBEANS, and Prof. Chris Elliott actively contributed to FoodRevolution® 2024 as both Advisory Board members and speakers.

Their role in the Advisory Board supported the scientific direction of the conference, ensuring strong focus on food safety, food integrity, and sustainability across modern food systems.

As speakers, Chiara addressed key challenges in the safety of plant-based meat and milk alternatives, while Chris provided a system-level perspective on delivering safe, sustainable, and healthy food in increasingly complex global supply chains.

Their participation reinforced the importance of scientific rigor, international collaboration, and evidence-based decision-making in shaping the future of food.
