The MYCOBEANS consortium met in Parma, hosted by UNIPR, for its mid-term meeting, focusing on a critical assessment of progress across the project.

Work packages were reviewed against objectives, timelines and scientific quality. Gaps were identified and priorities defined for the second half of the project, with continued emphasis on robustness, integration and impact on food safety.

The mid-term meeting concluded with a clear definition of priorities for the remaining project period.
