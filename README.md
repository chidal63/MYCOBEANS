# Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter
# MYCOBEANS website (GitHub Pages)

This repository hosts the public website for **MYCOBEANS** (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions — Staff Exchange).

Live site: **https://www.mycobeans.eu/**

## Scope
The website is a **project showcase and transparency tool**.
It is not intended as a stakeholder engagement platform and does not implement marketing features (no newsletter, no user profiling).

Primary functions:
- public visibility of the project
- clarity of objectives, structure and consortium roles
- audit- and review-proof dissemination

## Technology
- GitHub Pages
- Jekyll (Minimal Mistakes theme, remote theme)
- Static site (no backend)

## Analytics
The site uses **GoatCounter** (privacy-friendly, cookieless) for aggregated traffic statistics.  
No Google Analytics and no tracking cookies set by the website.

## Updates policy (SITE FREEZE)
The site is under a **structure freeze**.

Allowed changes (content-only):
- new posts under **Events**
- updates to **Resources** (e.g., adding new Zenodo DOIs and publications)
- minor typo fixes

Not allowed without explicit unfreeze:
- layout or navigation restructuring
- global CSS refactors (e.g., `head/custom.html`)
- theme changes or major visual redesign

If structural updates become necessary, create a dedicated commit explicitly stating:
`Unfreeze site for structural update`

## Repository structure (high level)
- `_pages/` — site pages
- `_posts/` — events/news posts
- `assets/` — images, logos, CSS assets
